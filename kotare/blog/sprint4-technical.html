            <h3>getting blocked on a simple problem</h3>
            <p>
              - What was the problem?<br />
              I was over thinking the problem, thinking the solution was more
              complicated that was required.
            </p>
            <p>
              - What problem solving techniques did you use?<br />
              I think I'm getting a lot better with utilizing reading error
              messages, console.logging, and Googling. This with just going one
              step at a time and going back to the instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              - How did I feel throughout the process?<br />
              Really frustrated. But then through regular breaks, some
              procrastinating, and ten some problem solving techniques I was
              able to solve the problem. Sometimes when you get a spark of
              inspiration you run with it and sometimes as you see everything
              unfold towards you resolving the problem you get more excited and
              focused on the challenge at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              - What did I learn?<br />
              I've learned that a lot of the times where I am stuck, it is
              usually some random minuscule error or miss understanding with
              regards to what I'm actually trying to accomplish.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>solving a problem in an elegant way</h3>
            <p>
              - What was the problem?<br />
              There were some challenge's in the Kata section where it just came
              intuitively to me, and it was like the code just rolled off of my
              fingers.
            </p>
            <p>
              - What problem solving techniques did you use?<br />
              I used the Mozilla Documentation, and Stackoverflow and with some
              poking around I was very quickly able to work out the solution to
              the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              - How did you feel throughout the process?<br />
              It felt quite fluid.. in terms of being agile and being able to
              quickly and easily overcome little hurdles. I felt a sense of
              understanding about what was needed, and where I'd find the
              information required for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              - What did you learn?<br />
              I learnt how amazing it feels when it just works and you
              understand what you're doing and how it all clicks together. This
              feeling is the chase.. the ecstasy of success in writing readable,
              and working code.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>problem solving techniques</h3>
            <p>
              2/5 Pseudocode<br /> This is definitely something that I need to get
              better at doing. I guess daily practice will help to improve this.
            </p>
            <p>
              3/5 Trying something<br /> I think coming up with a plan, and then just
              going for it, and really just trying to make it work helps. Some
              times you'll refactor what you've written, or just go and try it
              from a different angle.
            </p>
            <p>
              1/5 Rubber ducky method<br /> In all honestly.. I haven't even tried
              this one.
            </p>
            <p>
              4/5 Reading error messages<br /> I think I have a pretty good
              understanding of utilising this. The majorit of the Kata's I was
              able to work off of the error messages that were provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              5/5 Console.logging<br /> From my experience with working through
              freecodecamp.org I had already established a process of utilising
              `console.log` to test my code as I progressed with my code.
            </p>
            <p>
              4/5 Googling<br /> This is something that came quite naturally to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              1/5 Asking your peers for help<br /> 0/5 Asking coaches for help<br /> I have
              been terrible with these.. defineitely something to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.5/5 Improving your process with reflection<br /> A lot of my coding
              progress through the Katas have come from reflecting over my
              workable code, and then comparing it to the supplied solution, and
              then against alternatives that I could find through Google.
