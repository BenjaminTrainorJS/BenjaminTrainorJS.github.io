# Got blocked on a simple problem
    - What was the problem?
    I was over thinking the problem, thinking the solution was more complicated that was required. 

    - What problem solving techniques did you use?
    I think I'm getting a lot better with utilizing reading error messages, console.logging, and Googling. This with just going one step at a time and going back to the instructions.

    - How did you feel throughout the process?
    Really frustrated. But then through regular breaks, some procrastinating, and ten some problem solving techniques I was able to solve the problem. Sometimes when you get a spark of inspiration you run with it and sometimes as you see everything unfold towards you resolving the problem you get more excited and focused on the challenge at hand.

    - What did you learn?
    I've learned that a lot of the times where I am stuck, it is usually some random minuscule error or miss understanding with regards to what I'm actually trying to accomplish. 


# Solved a problem in an elegant way.
    - What was the problem?
    There were some challenge's in the Kata section where it just came intuitively to me, and it was like the code just rolled off of my fingers.

    - What problem solving techniques did you use?
    I used the Mozilla Documentation, and Stackoverflow and with some poking around I was very quickly able to work out the solution to the challenge. 

    - How did you feel throughout the process?
    It felt quite fluid.. in terms of being agile and being able to quickly and easily overcome little hurdles. I felt a sense of understanding about what was needed, and where I'd find the information required for it. 

    - What did you learn?
    I learnt how amazing it feels when it just works and you understand what you're doing and how it all clicks together. This feeling is the chase.. the ecstasy of success in writing readable, and working code.


2/5     Pseudocode

        This is definitely something that I need to get better at doing. I guess daily practice will help to improve this.

3/5     Trying something

        I think coming up with a plan, and then just going for it, and really just trying to make it work helps. Some times you'll refactor what you've written, or just go and try it from a different angle. 

1/5     Rubber ducky method

        In all honestly.. I haven't even tried this one.

4/5     Reading error messages

        I think I have a pretty good understanding of utilising this. The majorit of the Kata's I was able to work off of the error messages that were provided.

5/5     Console.logging

        From my experience with working through freecodecamp.org I had already established a process of utilising `console.log` to test my code as I progressed with my code.

4/5     Googling

        This is something that came quite naturally to me.

1/5     Asking your peers for help
0/5     Asking coaches for help

        I have been terrible with these..  defineitely something to work on.

3.5/5   Improving your process with reflection

        A lot of my coding progress through the Katas have come from reflecting over my workable code, and then comparing it to the supplied solution, and then against alternatives that I could find through Google.
