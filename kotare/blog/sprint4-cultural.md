Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
----------------------------------

- Discuss your understanding about Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning.


# Neuroplasticity

According to neurologist and educator Judy Willis, neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains.

This means that when people repeatedly practice an activity or access a memory, their neural networks -- groups of neurons that fire together, creating electrochemical pathways -- shape themselves according to that activity or memory. When people stop practicing new things, the brain will eventually eliminate, or "prune," the connecting cells that formed the pathways.

Neuroscientists have been chorusing "cells that fire together, wire together" since the late 1990s, meaning that if you perform a task or recall some information that causes different neurons to fire in concert, it strengthens the connections between those cells.

Hence Willis says, "Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes."

Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.

Therefore understanding neuroplasticity gives you the insight that you can change or influence your brain in being able to learn, develop and utilise new skills and knowledge, through practice, lots of it.

This knowledge of Neuroplasticity leads us to an increased, more positive outlook on learning, studying, and overcoming coming challenges to both learning and studying. 

# Growth Mindset

A Growth Mindset is a mindset is opposite to that of a fixed mindset, and a fixed mindset means that your talents, skills, and intelligence is fixed.. which is totally false!

But we, like a lot of people, sometimes get suck in a rut, believing that we cannot progress pasted an obstacle because we cannot change, or improve. 

When we flip this mindset, from "I'm so dumb!" and "I'll never be able to learn this!".. to "I can re-wire my brain" and "I need to practice this in a way that I understand" we are opening ourselves up to a way to re-wire our brains.

This is how having a Growth Mindset and a knowledge of Neuroplasticity come hand-in-hand to skill us with the know-how to get onto the path of learning, progression and understanding. 

# Why is it important?

During this experience of progressing through Dev Academy's Foundation curriculum, I have found that there have been times where I have really struggled to get passed a particular learning obstacle. I have been able to work through, or work passed these obstacles as I have taken courage from my knowledge that through persistent work, and practice that I am able to learn, and develop my capacity to learn and comprehend difficult subjects.
