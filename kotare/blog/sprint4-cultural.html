            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
              According to neurologist and educator Judy Willis, neuroplasticity
              is defined as the selective organising of connections between
              neurons in our brains.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that when people repeatedly practice an activity or
              access a memory, their neural networks -- groups of neurons that
              fire together, creating electrochemical pathways -- shape
              themselves according to that activity or memory. When people stop
              practicing new things, the brain will eventually eliminate, or
              "prune," the connecting cells that formed the pathways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroscientists have been chorusing "cells that fire together,
              wire together" since the late 1990s, meaning that if you perform a
              task or recall some information that causes different neurons to
              fire in concert, it strengthens the connections between those
              cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence Willis says, "Practice makes permanent. The more times the
              network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it
              becomes."
            </p>
            <p>
              Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a
              memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build
              thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore understanding neuroplasticity gives you the insight that
              you can change or influence your brain in being able to learn,
              develop and utilise new skills and knowledge, through practice,
              lots of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This knowledge of Neuroplasticity leads us to an increased, more
              positive outlook on learning, studying, and overcoming coming
              challenges to both learning and studying.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>
              A Growth Mindset is a mindset is opposite to that of a fixed
              mindset, and a fixed mindset means that your talents, skills, and
              intelligence is fixed.. which is totally false!
            </p>
            <p>
              But we, like a lot of people, sometimes get suck in a rut,
              believing that we cannot progress pasted an obstacle because we
              cannot change, or improve.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we flip this mindset, from "I'm so dumb!" and "I'll never be
              able to learn this!".. to "I can re-wire my brain" and "I need to
              practice this in a way that I understand" we are opening ourselves
              up to a way to re-wire our brains.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is how having a Growth Mindset and a knowledge of
              Neuroplasticity come hand-in-hand to skill us with the know-how to
              get onto the path of learning, progression and understanding.

            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>
              During this experience of progressing through Dev Academy's
              Foundation curriculum, I have found that there have been times
              where I have really struggled to get passed a particular learning
              obstacle. I have been able to work through, or work passed these
              obstacles as I have taken courage from my knowledge that through
              persistent work, and practice that I am able to learn, and develop
              my capacity to learn and comprehend difficult subjects.
