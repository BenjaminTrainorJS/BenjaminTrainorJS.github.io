                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            The more I read, observe others code, and play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the
                            more I begin to truly see the amazing power that lies in these three technologies. HTML
                            (Hyper Text Mark-up Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript (also known as
                            ECMAScript) are the 3 key, foundational tools one needs to understand to create amazing
                            websites.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            When thinking of a way to describe HTML and CSS, I think of a trip to the Whitsunday's in
                            Central Queensland. On this trip I went scuba diving at the great barrier reef. And when I
                            think of the great barrier reef I think of 'Finding Nemo'. I see this large structure and
                            framework of living coral, strong, sturdy, but adaptable. Then I see the various fishes, and
                            sea creatures and plants that beautify the vast structure of the coral. Two separate things,
                            but together they become one big living thriving organism. With structure, beauty and
                            function.

                            Like the coral and sea creatures of the Great Barrier Reef, HTML and CSS are both very much
                            separate technologies, but go hand-in-hand to create a truly marvelous collaboration of
                            structure, functionality, and style.

                            HTML provides the Semantic structure and meaning to the content of our website/web-app. This
                            is done through the form of < tags>, these < tags> to inform other web technologies,
                                    frameworks, and languages the meaning of our information.

                            CSS builds upon the structure of HTML to bring color and style to our HTML. This is done
                            through the use of CSS Syntax.

                            You have a selector ie a < h1>
                                </h1> HTML tag followed by open a closed curly braces '{}', inside
                                these curly braces we have a declaration which is made up of a property ie color,
                                followed by a colon, followed by a value ie a color 'blue'. This selector and
                                declaration is then interpreted by the browser to provide the color and style to our
                                content.

                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            In programming languages like Javascript, when we run the code, it is read from
                            left-to-right top-to-bottom. In these languages we are able to use commands to manipulate
                            the flow of how our lines of our code are utilized. In JavaScript and many other languages
                            these are called loops.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            A loop allows us to re-use the same code time and time again to work through a problem. A
                            typical loop is setup around a true-false conditional expression. If said conditional is
                            true then run this line of code.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            We can think of this as driving our vehicle to work. We start off at home with a set
                            distance to work say 20km, we can drive our car to the end of the drive way to the road and
                            we have a conditional expression, is the distance to work to the left less than the the
                            distance to work from the right. If this is true, then we turn left, if false then we turn
                            right, we then have a counter set to the current distance to work. At each subsequent
                            intersection we run the conditional expression. We will continue to run this series of
                            conditional expressions until the distance to work is equal to 0.

                            with it</h5>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            The DOM (Document Object Model) is the browsers way of structuring the HTML mark-up, CSS,
                            and JS in a away that the Browser understands, and then represents these values as a visual
                            representation in the browser window, this is what you see when you enter 'www.google.com'.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            In the Browsers DevTools we are able to access and view the DOM within the browser window.
                            In this we are able to select the specific CSS selectors and change them to represent a
                            different value ie from 'blue' to 'green'. We can also use the DevTools and scripting files
                            (ie JavaScript) to change how the content interacts through the use of 'DOM elements'.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            You could use these interactions in a away where you are adding an item to a list,
                            JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to add an additional < div> with specific styling, and
                                text
                                content. JavaScript can also be used to delete an item in the same list. All of this is
                                done without the webpage needing to be refreshed or reloaded.

                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            An Array is a collection of data types, for example: </br>
                            </br>
                            - Strings: 'hello world'</br>
                            - Boolean: true false</br>
                            - numbers: 256</br>

                            let beautiful = ['blood', 'sweat', 'tears'];

                        <p class="article-paragraph">
                            You can access a value inside the array through referencing it's index. Arrays use an index
                            of 0 ie array[0]</br>
                            </br>
                            See example: console.log(beautiful[2]) // returns 'tears'</br>

                            </br>
                            An Object is accessed by calling it's property using two different syntaxes. Dot notation,
                            and using [] square brackets.</br>

                            }</br>
                            </br>
                            Dot notation as follows:</br>

                            </br>
