### What is my site's primary purpose
    - Blog to document my learning journey throughout my experience with EDA.
    - To show case my job ready skills to potential employers.

### Who is my audience (is it kids, adults, academics)
    - My target audience will be for fellow members of my cohort, as well as for my EDA facilitators, and for those in industry looking at my code/commits etc.

### How will I build my site to support their user experience
    - I think my audience will mainly view my blog via a desktop computer rather than tablet or mobile. 

### Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!

### What other directories do I need (e.g images). Where do I put that directory?

### Do I want the style to be applied to your blog entries also?
    - Yeah, I will have a style.css file that will cover the styling for all blog posts as well as my main page.
