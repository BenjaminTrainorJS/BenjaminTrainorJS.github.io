            <h2>sprint one - core: identity, values and strengths</h2>

            <p class="date">23 April 2020</p>

            <section>
                <h4>describe your personal values</h4>
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed
                        up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the
                        action you took.</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">I am currently woking as a Personal Care Worker in an Aged Care Facility.
                        In this position I have a Duty of Care within my scope of practice. There have been situations
                        where I'm working in a pair with a co-worker and they either out of laziness or poor training,
                        fail to do something that is quite important. Aged care recipiant has a right to dignity of
                        living, and to be respected. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">I have grown up in a largely religious culture which has instilled core
                        conservative values. These have been shaped and changed through life experience, and through
                        social interactions and cultural experiences abroad. I've had a close relationship with my
                        grandparents who grew in rural country NZ/UK and so their hard work ethic has rubbed off onto
                        me, as well as respect, and integrity. I have spent two years living in Auckland amongst friends
                        who are Samoan/ Tongan and I really felt that the layers of my beliefs were aligned in terms of
                        trying to understand the importance of language, culture, life, family, freedom and religion
                        from a different perspective. In Melbourne I worked on a farm where I was the supervisor of 12
                        employees who were immigrants from Cambodia. Working with them for 2 and half years was
                        incredibly rewarding and during the process of learning some of their language and working
                        along-side them I gained a greater appreciation for communty and community support for them
                        living in a foreign country. This led me to back-pack through SE-Asia in 2017 and delve-deeper
                        into the hidden parts of the countries and cultures that I visited. This has led me to meet my
                        wife Ingrid who is from Taiwan. Through this journey of self discovery I have found the values
                        of inclusion, respect, and hardwork to be extremely valuable. </p>
                </div>

                <h4>describe your strengths and limitations</h4>
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Strengths: Passionate, extremely excited about learning, always seeking
                        opportunities for opportunities to learn and progress. I am always thinking of how I can
                        improve, what new skills will improve my careers prospects.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Limitations: If I'm stuck doing something that is mundane I struggle with
                        motivation. Also if I have to do a lot of essay writing then I greatly lose interest. Really
                        struggling with this assignment. I have a history of not finishing projects or things that I
                        start. I try to be persistent, but working with a curriculum will definitely help me to stay
                        focus on what is required in the moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                        intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">I really enjoy learning by doing, and I am also a fan of learning by
                        teaching others, this 'flipped classroom' mode of EDA really resonated with me as I researched
                        what I wanted to pursue. I really enjoyed learning about neuroplasticity and undertanding this I
                        think will help with focus to keep practicing.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>3. Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with
                        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how
                        effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
                    </h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">At work we were redisgning our production processes, after some push
                        back, we decided to involve the entire production team to provide input in the new design. We
                        spent the time explaining what we were trying to accomplish and they bought into it. We were
                        able to redign with their input, and were able to implement them without many issues. </p>
