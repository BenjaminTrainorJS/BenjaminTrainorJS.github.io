                        <div>
                            <h3>1. What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">From what I have seen with future growth and opportunities I
                                think I would like to see how I go with DevOps. I believe to start with I should build a
                                good strong foundation in the production life-cycle of software, and build experience
                                into a Senior Dev role. I have been looking at Companies that I could see myself working
                                for and definitely Atlassian is one of those companies that I could work for. They have
                                Front-end and Java jobs that require a good grasp of React/JS and then Java as well. But
                                I'm all for developing my language toolset. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>2. What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in
                                yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">I come from a Operations background as senior supervior and as
                                Production/Operations Manager. So I'd like to see how I can bring these sills to the
                                table within the dev environment. Not necessarily managing people, but seeing how I can
                                lead from a Developer perspective. How I can mentor, and support the growth of the the
                                others in my cohort and project teams. Once I can gain the practical experience I think
                                a role as a Senior Developer would suit me well as I enjoy mentoring and developing
                                others.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>3. A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">I'm bold, I like to make a decision and run with it. I'm
                                passionate about people and how they can make or brake your organisation. A limitation
                                is that sometimes I can struggle with Impostor syndrome, and that can rattle me a bit.
                                Sometimes I'm not the greatet with focus, but I am a professional and stick to my guns
                                about honouring commitments and doing what I say I will do.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>4. Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in
                                this programme. This should
                                include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
                                with other learners,
                                facilitators and industry/community representatives. </h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">I have begun to use a 30min pomodoro timer to keep track and to
                                work on focused 30min sprints, and then to have a break to keep me fresh, and then to
                                focus on another 30min sprint. I will be exercising in the mornings to keep me fresh and
                                energised. I will be professional in my actions, with respecting and honoring those
                                around me. I have a keen interest in networking and will be respectful of other peoples
                                time and their commitments to their study. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">If I come across a roadblock, I will set my pomodoro timer for 1
                                hour, and do my best to figure it out. If not I will turn to Stack overflow, and google
                                to figure it out, if I haven't after 30 minutes I will reach out to my cohort and those
                                on slack.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                            <p class="block-paragraph">I want someone to help point me in the right direction to work
                                out the solutions needed, rather than being 'shown to the well' so to speak. Also,
                                sometimes I can delve to deep in an area of interest but which is a tanget to what I
                                should be focusing on. I guess to some extent I enjoy keeping myself accountable and
                                checking in on what I am doing. So perhaps 2 video zoom session a week would be great
                                during Foundations. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other
                                things. For example, you might have
                                whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
                            <p>Right now I am transitioning out of doing part-time
                                night-shifts.. but should be finished by the first week of May. </p>
