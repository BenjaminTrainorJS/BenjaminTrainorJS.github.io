                    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">
                        <ul class="articleListItems">
                            <li>How to interpret ourselves, where our emotions arise from, how our childhoods influence
                                us, how we might best navigate our fears and wishes. </li>
                            <li>Self awareness, self management of emotions (in effective ways), social-awareness or
                                applied empathy, social-management. </li>
                            <li>Self-Awareness: Knowing why I want to become a programmer. A true and clear inner sense
                                of awareness of my true skills, interests and characteristics which act as the
                                foundation for my journey.</li>
                            <li>Social-Awareness: Acknowledging how my code directly adds value to a specific group of
                                people. Plus, the 'active listening' skills required to absorb clarity on your end user,
                                team, and client needs.</li>
                            <li>You absolutely have to train your brain to be resilient.</li>
                            <li>Limbic System vs Neocortex </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">There are many different forms of IQ, from analytical, to commercial, but
                        EQ is about understanding yourself.. your emotions, managing them, observing the emotional being
                        of others and how you can help them. EQ is being aware of the present, and consciously deciding
                        how we use our emotions for our progression and learning. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">It would improve the cohesion and synergy experienced within a group
                        working environment. It would help with our self-learning, and professional development. Help us
                        to process and work through personal and professional trauma. </p>
